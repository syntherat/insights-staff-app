# v1.2.4 Release Notes

## ✅ Improvements
- Added close action for looked-up wallet views across Arcade Game, Prize, and Gate pages.
- Improved scanner detection for barcodes (1D formats) while keeping QR support.
- Updated scanner detection behavior to avoid duplicate/unstable reads.

## 📦 Build & Release
- Android release pipeline now builds split APKs per ABI (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`) instead of one universal APK.
- This reduces per-device download/install size significantly.

## 🛠 Stability
- Continued Android release signing/workflow hardening from prior fixes.

## Installation note
For most modern Android phones, install the `arm64-v8a` APK from this release.
