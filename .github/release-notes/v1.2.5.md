# v1.2.5 Release Notes

## ✅ Session & Login Reliability
- Extended staff session lifetime to 30 days.
- Added rolling session renewal: every authenticated app activity refreshes token validity.
- App now refreshes session on launch/resume so opening the app extends the 30-day window.
- If session is expired/invalid, app automatically logs out and routes to login.

## 🎯 Arcade Gate Status Highlights
- Updated gate check-in status highlight colors:
  - Not checked in / pending: **Yellow**
  - Approved / checked in: **Green**
  - Rejected: **Red**
- Fixed status matching priority to prevent `NOT_CHECKED...` from being misclassified as checked-in.

## 📦 Build & Release

## Installation note
For most modern Android phones, install the `arm64-v8a` APK from this release.
