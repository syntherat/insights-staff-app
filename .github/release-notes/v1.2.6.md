# v1.2.6 Release Notes

## 🐛 Critical Fix: Session Validation
- Fixed redirect loop issue affecting all app pages after login.
- App now validates session token *before* restoring auth state on hydration.
- Pages no longer load with stale/expired tokens that trigger immediate logout.

## ✅ Session Behavior
- Expired tokens (401): App stays logged out and redirects to login.
- Network errors during validation: Session is preserved temporarily for offline grace period.
- Valid tokens: Session is restored and pages load normally.

## 📦 Build & Release
- Released via GitHub Actions with signed split APKs.

## Installation note
For most modern Android phones, install the `arm64-v8a` APK from this release.
