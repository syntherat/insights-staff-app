# v1.2.7 Release Notes

## ✅ Session Stability Fix
- Fixed navigation reset issue where loading data could send users back to Home.
- Router now listens only to login state (`logged in / logged out`) and no longer rebuilds on token-rotation updates.
- This stabilizes flows like Profile, Staff Checkin Days, Arcade lookup, and QR scan actions.

## 📦 Build Outputs
- Android split APKs:
  - `armeabi-v7a`
  - `arm64-v8a`
  - `x86_64`
- iOS build artifact:
  - `Runner.app` packaged as zip from a release `--no-codesign` build.

## 🛠 CI / Release Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow now builds both Android and iOS artifacts for the same tag.
- GitHub Release attaches both Android APKs and iOS zip in one release.

## Installation notes
- Android: install the `arm64-v8a` APK on most modern devices.
- iOS: artifact is an unsigned build output intended for testing/distribution workflows that handle signing separately.
